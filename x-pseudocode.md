## Other Things to Note
 * Components we should have
    - single Header
    - Single navigation component within header that will conditionally render different sections
    - single project component
    - single footer component 

* Each project card should have 
    - image of application, either gif or screenshot
    - title of the project
    - link to the deployed application
    - link to github

* Design should be mobile first, with a good color pallete and a large readable font. 

* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.


## Things To Do

* ~~Build Project.js generic card that we can inject our specific data into~~

* ~~Build contact form~~

* Add Icons to Footer with react-icons
